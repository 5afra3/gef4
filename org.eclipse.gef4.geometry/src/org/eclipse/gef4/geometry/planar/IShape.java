/**
 * <p>
 * The IShape interface is the counterpart of the ICurve interface, in that it
 * brings together operations to be used on areal geometric objects, such as
 * Polygons. An IShape allows to test if an IGeometry is fully contained by the
 * IShape using the contains(IGeometry) method. An IGeometry is considered to be
 * fully contained by an IShape if the IShape contains all the Points that
 * constitute the IGeometry in question. Moreover, the closed outline of an
 * IShape can be retrieved via the getOutline() method. It is defined to be an
 * IPolyCurve. If you want to process the outline segments individually, you can
 * use the getOutlineSegments() method, instead.
