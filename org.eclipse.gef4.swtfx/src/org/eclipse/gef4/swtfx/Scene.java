	 * TODO: pulse-updates
	 * 
	 * We need to create a pulse thread, i.e. a thread that will call pulse
	 * listeners every X millis. JavaFX uses 60Hz frequency for pulses. I do not
	 * think we need such a fine granularity (which is typical for games!). 30Hz
	 * should be enough for SwtFX.
	 * 
	 * Although JavaFX uses the underlying toolkit to generate the pulse, I want
	 * to create one pulse thread per Scene. In the real world, you will rarely
	 * feel the need for more than a couple of Scenes in your application
	 * (main-editor, outline-view).
	 * 
	 * The scene will then register itself as a pulse-listener on the newly
	 * created pulse-thread. Inside that pulse-listener, a layout pass is
	 * performed and SWT is asked to redraw the Scene. Rendering is fully
	 * controlled by SWT, we just tell SWT when we need to redraw.
	 * 
	 * Animations could either register on the Scene or also on the pulse
	 * thread.

	 * TODO: layout-roots
	 * 
	 * The root IParent of the scene graph is coupled to the Scene's width and
	 * height. When the Scene's width or height changes, that change is
	 * propagated to the scene graph root and a layout pass is performed on the
	 * root.
	 * 
	 * Additionally, there are so called layout-roots which are *unmanaged*
	 * IParents anywhere in the scene graph. As you know, an unmanaged node is
	 * not laid out by its parent, i.e. its position and size are not set by its
	 * parent. That's why layout requests will not propagate above unmanaged
	 * parents. But as all parents (unmanaged ones, too) are responsible for
	 * laying out their managed children, we need to trigger their layout()
	 * method in a layout pass if one of their children requested re-layouting.
	 * 
	 * That's why we manage a dirty-layout-roots list. All layout-roots will
	 * mark themselves as needing to re-layout when a child requests
	 * re-layouting. For the sake of simplicity, we can safely add the scene
	 * graph root to the dirty-layout-roots list when the Scene's width or
	 * height changes. So that a layout pass is simply calling the layout()
	 * method on all dirty-layout-roots.
	 * 
	 * JavaFX uses two dirty-layout-roots lists, because they allow one
	 * layout-pass to mark nodes as needing a re-layout. I cannot imagine a
	 * situation where one layout pass is not enough. Maybe we have to run into
	 * bugs before implementing it the same way.
