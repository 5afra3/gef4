/**
 * A <code>Tool</code> interprets Mouse and Keyboard input from an
 * {@link AbstractEditDomain} and its {@link IEditPartViewer EditPartViewers}. The active
 * Tool and its state determines how the EditDomain will interpret input. Input
 * flows from a Viewer, to the EditDomain, to the EditDomain's active Tool.
 * <P>
 * <code>Tools</code> process low-level events and turn them into higher-level
 * operations. These operations are encapsulated by {@link IRequest Requests}.
 * The Requests are then used to communicate with EditParts in the Viewer to
 * perform the User's operation. Using Requests, Tools will:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Ask EditParts for {@link org.eclipse.gef4.mvc.commands.AbstractCommand Commands} to
 * perform changes on the model.
 * <LI>Ask EditParts to show and erase feedback during an operation.
 * <LI>Ask EditParts to perform a generic function, using
 * {@link org.eclipse.gef4.mvc.parts.IEditPart#performRequest(IRequest)}.
 * <P>
 * Tools also perform operations that do not involve the EditParts directly,
 * such as changing the Viewer's selection, scrolling the viewer, or invoking an
 * {@link org.eclipse.jface.action.IAction Action}.
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <td valign=top><img src="doc-files/important.gif"/>
 * <td>All feedback should be erased and temporary changes reverted prior to
 * executing any command.
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td valign=top><img src="doc-files/important.gif"/>
 * <td>Tools should process most keystrokes. For example, the DELETE key should
 * <EM>not</EM> be handled by adding a KeyListener to the Viewer's Control.
 * Doing so would mean that pressing DELETE would <EM>not</EM> be sensitive to
 * which Tool is currently active, and the state of the Tool. See
 * {@link org.eclipse.gef.KeyHandler} for how keystrokes are generally
 * processed.
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: This interface is <EM>not</EM> intended to be implemented by
 * clients. Clients should inherit from
 * {@link org.eclipse.gef4.mvc.tools.AbstractTool}. New methods may be added in the
 * future.
