/**
 * A pluggable contribution implementing a portion of an EditPart's behavior.
 * EditPolicies contribute to the overall <i>editing behavior</i> of an
 * EditPart. Editing behavior is defined as one or more of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Command Creation </b>- Returning a <code>Command</code> in response to
 * {@link #getCommand(IRequest)}
 * <li><b>Feedback Management</b> - Showing/erasing source and/or target
 * feedback in response to Requests.
 * <li><b>Delegation/Forwarding</b> - Collecting contributions from other
 * EditParts (and therefore their EditPolicies). In response to a given
 * <code>Request</code>, an EditPolicy may create a derived Request and forward
 * it to other EditParts. For example, during the deletion of a composite
 * EditPart, that composite may consult its children for contributions to the
 * delete command. Then, if the children have any additional work to do, they
 * will return additional comands to be executed.
 * </ul>
 * <P>
 * EditPolicies should determine an EditPart's editing capabilities. It is
 * possible to implement an EditPart such that it handles all editing
 * responsibility. However, it is much more flexible and object-oriented to use
 * EditPolicies. Using policies, you can pick and choose the editing behavior
 * for an EditPart without being bound to its class hierarchy. Code reuse is
 * increased, and code management is easier.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: This interface is <EM>not</EM> intended to be implemented by
 * clients. Clients should inherit from
 * {@link org.eclipse.gef4.mvc.policies.AbstractEditPolicy}. New methods may be
 * added in the future.
