- Convert example geometries to be origin-based, position them via affine transform
- Use poly beziers as connection visuals; adjust ChopboxAnchor so they render properly
- Add outline and midpoint handles for all kind of shapes; restrict resizing options for rectangle-based shapes via constraints on handles
- Add support for removing bendpoints and outline segment midpoint handles
- Add support for cursor changes to tools/handles
- Marquee Selection

- Ensure factories and policies can be obtained on a default/type/instance based binding registry
- Ensure default model implementations can be binded (using DI or custom binding mechanism) per viewer (no type/instance binding)
- Ensure visual part and content part registries are based on scopes (hierarchy)

- Show how shapes can be attached to each other via anchors (G shape of logo)
- PropertySheet integration to change visual properties of FXGeometricVisuals (incl. UNDO)
- Implement resize for arbitrary geometric shapes (by using scaling)
- Implement undo/redo for resize and move

- Implement zooming based on gesture

- Add viewport (scrolling) model and tools for scrolling and related birdeye view to UI feature)
- Add focus model (keyboard focus)
